* Week 6 - Assignment: Working with strings in Python

** Instructions:
1. Open [[https://colab.research.google.com/][Google Colaboratory]].
2. Switch off AI assistance (`Tools` > `Settings` > `AI Assistant` >
   `Hide AI assistant`)
3. Complete the following tasks in the notebook 
4. After completing the tasks, save the notebook and generate the shareable link.
5. Submit the shareable URL to Canvas.

** Tasks:

1. *Task 1: Storing and Printing a String*
   
   Store the string `"Hello, world!"` in a variable called =greeting=
   and then print it.

2. *Task 2: Concatenating Strings*

   Concatenate the following two strings and print the result:  
   - =first_part = "Hello, "=  
   - =second_part = "Python learners!"=

3. *Task 3: Taking Input from the User*

   Write a small program that:
   - Asks the user to input their name.
   - Prints a welcome message like: =Nice to meet you, [Name]!=

4. *Task 4: Printing Special Characters*

   Print the following multi-line string that contains special
   characters:
   
   #+begin_quote
   Hello, world!
   Python is awesome.
   Let's learn together! \n Happy Coding! 
   #+end_quote

5. *Optional Task: Exploring Python Documentation and Errors*

   Check out the official Python documentation for the =print()= and
   =input()= functions at [[https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/inputoutput.html#][docs.python.org]].

   Additionally, find out what an =EOFError= is and how you can generate
   one in Python. Write a short summary and optionally demonstrate how
   to trigger the error in a Colab notebook.

Once you complete all the tasks, save the notebook, click on the
"Share" button in the top-right corner of the Google Colaboratory
interface, and generate a shareable link. Submit this link on Canvas.
