* Course description

This course on "Game Programming in Python" offers a comprehensive
introduction to the fundamentals of creating interactive and engaging
computer games. Students will learn how to use Python, a powerful and
versatile programming language, to bring their game concepts to life,
focusing on game logic, graphics rendering, and user interaction. The
curriculum covers key programming concepts, game design principles,
and the integration of libraries such as Turtle or Pygame, providing a
hands-on approach through project-based learning. By the end of the
course, participants will have developed several games from scratch,
demonstrating their understanding of the game development process and
their ability to apply programming skills in a creative
context. Acquiring programming skills in Python will not only help you
understand how computers can be used to create interactive experiences
but also enhance your critical thinking abilities. We will meet weekly
for 50 minutes of lectures, practical problem solving and interactive
exercises. Between classes, students will work on small assignments,
leading to the opportunity to present their work and (optionally)
publish their finished projects for the whole world to see at the
Humanities, Arts, and Science (H.A.T.S.) symposium at Lyon College.

* Learning Objectives

- Understand the basics of Python programming, including syntax, data
  types, and control structures.
- Learn how to use Python libraries such as =turtle= and =pygame= for game
  development.
- Develop skills in game design and storytelling to create engaging
  game narratives.
- Master game logic and problem-solving to implement game mechanics
  and player interactions.
- Gain proficiency in graphics rendering, including working with
  images, animations, and game environments.
- Explore the development of responsive user interfaces to enhance
  gameplay experience.
- Practice project-based learning to design, develop, and debug Python
  games from scratch.
- Enhance critical thinking and analytical skills through practical
  problem-solving exercises.
- Encourage creativity and innovation in applying programming skills
  to game development.
- Prepare for presenting and optionally publishing projects at the
  H.A.T.S. symposium.
