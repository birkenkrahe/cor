Plato's Analogy of the Cave

- Could the theory of (perfect) forms be useful somewhere?
- How does the allegory make you feel?
- What does the allegory make you think of?

* Group exercise

1) Form groups of 5-6 people
   - One of you is Socrates ("the philosopher").
   - One of you is Meno ("the curious").
   - One of you is Anytus ("the man").
   - One of you is an observer of the conversation.
   - One of you is a recorder of the conversation.

2) Have a 5 minute "Socratic dialog" on the question "Can machines
   develop human intelligence?" (I'll time you.)

3) Record your results and report to the class (5 min max per group):
   every member of the group must give its view of the dialog.

4) The purpose is not to find a good answer to the question (that
   would be very difficult without additional research) but to test
   your "Socratic tools" after reading the text.

* Assignment: Self-Examination Essay



- *At the end of the term*, you'll have to write a paper of 2-3 pages,
  casting yourself in the role of young Meno, and reflect on:

  1) What did you learn through the theme of this course ("Game
     Programming with Python")?
  2) When did you experience 'growing pains' in learning something new?
  3) How did you know that you learnt anything new?
  4) What learning will you still have to do about "Game Programming
     in Python"?
  5) How would you know that you still have something to learn?

- *Criteria:*
  1. Depth of self-examination
  2. Reference to direct evidence from Meno
  3. Concrete examples from the course
  4. Well-organized text (headings, body paragraphs)
  5. Well-edited and error-free.
