Reflecting on teaching game programming in Python, Plato’s /Meno/ brings
up essential questions about knowledge: "How do we know what we know?"
and "How do we recognize the need for further learning?" Like Meno
questioning Socrates, I find myself revisiting my own approach to
learning and teaching. As Donald Knuth puts it, “Everyday life is like
programming. If you love something, you can put beauty into it”
(Knuth, 1997). This perspective—an approach that values clarity and
depth—has been central to my teaching, shaped by years of coding and
my commitment to literate programming, which sees code not just as
technical instructions but as a thoughtful expression of ideas.

* Game Programming with Python: Beyond Syntax and Structure

Teaching game programming with Python is more than syntax; it’s about
sharing a cognitive framework for problem-solving and
creativity. Python offers a medium for exploring logical structures,
and my students’ early projects—such as a number-guessing
game—introduced them to the fundamentals of programming: variables,
loops, and conditional statements. These projects are more than
technical exercises; they foster an evolving way of thinking, much
like the self-reflective approach Socrates promotes in his dialogues
(Plato, trans. 1994).

My own programming journey began with languages like FORTRAN and
BASIC, a background that influences how I teach today. I vividly
remember being captivated as a teenager by a 3D maze game on the
TI-99, struck by the idea that code could bring concepts to
life. Today, I see that same spark in my students, who approach Python
as a language that enables them to create something meaningful. I
emphasize literate programming techniques (Knuth, 1984) to help
students see programming as an extension of their thought
processes. For them, documenting logic and expressing intent within
their code makes their work both functional and readable.

* Struggles and Milestones: Navigating the Growing Pains of Learning and Teaching

Learning to program, like learning any skill, has its
frustrations. Teaching it reminds me of the “learning paradox”
Socrates raises in /Meno/—the tension between realizing something
isn’t fully understood and the struggle to make sense of it (Plato,
trans. 1994). Debugging sessions can be frustrating, yet they model
perseverance and attention to detail, qualities fundamental to
problem-solving. Debugging mirrors the “back and forth” questioning in
the Socratic method, where each error and correction brings the
learner closer to clarity (Vlastos, 1991).

These learning struggles often bring a mix of frustration and
reward. Teaching students how to debug a syntax error or troubleshoot
conditional logic reminds me of my own early days with FORTRAN, where
one small typo could disrupt an entire calculation. I find these
experiences reinforce Knuth’s view that love for one’s work brings
beauty, even to the meticulous process of debugging (Knuth,
1997). Through each student’s process, I am reminded that programming
offers as much insight as it does skill, merging functionality with an
elegance grounded in logic.

* Markers of New Learning: Recognizing Growth

How do I recognize that I’ve learned something new? Often, it begins
with clarity after confusion, when a previously opaque concept becomes
intuitive. For example, when students move from struggling with basic
loops to implementing effective game logic, they reveal their deepened
understanding. The value of literate programming (Knuth, 1984) is to
document this learning journey, helping students express their ideas
clearly in code and in words, as each “Aha!” moment is a marker of
genuine growth.

As students progress, I see their questions shift from syntax to
design and purpose, a shift I encourage through literate programming
techniques. By documenting their logic, they see how their thinking
evolves. For me, this aligns with Dewey’s concept of experiential
learning, which stresses learning through reflection and iterative
improvement (Dewey, 1938). Every time a student grapples with a new
concept or revisits an idea, it reinforces that knowledge is not
static but continuously built upon.

* Looking Forward: What Lies Ahead in Game Programming and Pedagogy

Programming—and teaching it—will always involve ongoing
learning. Topics like object-oriented design and algorithmic
efficiency are the next steps in my course, concepts that open doors
to more complex games and refined structures. And as I introduce
students to these concepts, I continue to draw on literate programming
to make code not just functional, but clear and expressive (Knuth,
1984).

In his reflection on knowledge, Socrates suggests that understanding
involves a willingness to continually seek answers and to reframe
one’s assumptions. This approach, coupled with Knuth’s appreciation
for the beauty in one’s work, guides me. Teaching is an iterative
journey that demands openness, humility, and appreciation for the
process of discovery, especially in programming, where knowledge
constantly evolves (Knuth, 1997; Plato, trans. 1994).

Ultimately, I approach teaching and learning as a lifelong dialogue,
one that requires both curiosity and commitment. Like Socrates, I find
that teaching is about asking better questions, and, like Knuth, I
believe that beauty can be found in the work itself. In programming,
as in life, learning is about refining our inquiries, cultivating
understanding, and embracing both the struggle and the elegance of
discovery.
