#+begin_notes
Welcome to the class! Finally! You've already more than completed one
of the assignments, namely winning the Scot's Race. Now you get a
paddle with your name on it, which will join the 'pantheon' (Πάνθειον)
in Ed's Commons, and I get to have a second paddle with my name on it!

This course was weird to begin with: "Game Programming in Python" in
15 weeks with 50 minutes per week? How is that ever going to work?
Well, it does and it doesn't. It gives you an opportunity to see how
computer and data science, the two things that I know something about,
is taught and run at Lyon - since we're a small department, you're
going to run into me about 1/2 of the time (or more, if you choose to
major in data science): so if you can't stand me, don't do it, but if
you don't mind me, do it because working with computers and data is
one of the most lucrative and most fun things that I can think about.

This term the course has become even weirder because Lyon received a
research grant to spruce up its freshman induction program (COR) with
some philosophy. Now, there is some philosophy in programming and
software engineering but it's hidden, and techies often have
difficulty talking about it. Why do you think that is?

Why don't techies like to talk about philosophy? 

#+begin_notes
The two people in the photo are Donald Knuth, perhaps the world's
foremost living computer scientist and author of the multi-volume "The
Art of Programming", and Hermann Zapf, a German typeface designer and
calligrapher, collaborating on the development of the $\TeX$
typesetting system.

Despite of this fact, you're caught in the spider net of philosophy
this term: together with all the other freshmen you'll have to read a
book by Plato, the "Meno" dialog (more about that later). Fortunately,
it is a very small book, but it packs a punch, as we will see.

In the first two weeks, besides some general instruction and a little
interactive computing with Python, we'll focus mostly on
philosophy. In fact, when I started my education, in Germany, I spent
a lot of time doing philosophy and "reading the Greeks" - in Greek.

* Socrates

#+begin_notes
The central person in the dialog you'll be reading is Socrates. He
never published anything as far as he know, but his friend and pupil
Plato put him in his works, and a few Greek playwrights used him, too.

Who was he?
- A gadfly (μύωψ): Impiety and corruption of the youth of Athens.
- Famous quotes: "I know that I know nothing," and "The unexamined
  life is not worth living." - Is either of these things really true?

Apart from that he is perhaps known to you for being in Assassin's
Creed, and for a method of inquiry, a way of exploring a topic that is
now called "the Socratic method". Do you already know what that is?

* Socrates

#+begin_notes
I found him annoying because he slows the game and the story down
without adding much to the plot or to the action.
#+end_notes

* Socrates' Tools

- *Elenchus* (ἔλεγχος) = refutation
- *Aporia* (ἀπορία) = riddles
- *Anamnesis* (ἀνάμνησις) = remembrance

#+begin_notes
The Socratic method is based on dialog - humans talking. Here are
three of its characteristics /in abstracto/, without examples or
details. You will find those in the text, and your first mission,
should you choose to accept it, is to read the text and identify
examples.
#+end_notes

* What questions are worth asking?
#+attr_html: :width 600px:
[[../img/socrates.jpg]]

#+begin_notes
The method is about asking questions, asking the right questions, and
trying to get somewhere purely by way of logic. What is logic? It's a
set of methods used to test for truth or untruth - it is the basis of
mathematical proofs and all computing. So it's not only philosophical!

Questions that Socrates and Meno wrestle with in the book include:
- What is virtue?
- Can virtue be taught?
- What is knowledge?
- What is the difference between knowing and believing?
- Is learning possible or is it just remembering?
- What is the role of inquiry?

* Is programming fun?

#+begin_notes
Is this the kind of question that Socrates would have tackled with his
method? Answer: No, it is not! Though programming can be defined,
"fun" is inherently subjective and personal though shared across
people.
#+end_notes

* Can game programming be taught?

#+begin_notes
- Why do you think yes/no?
- Form groups of 4-5 people.
- Identify a reporter and a group leader.
- Write down your arguments.
- Write down how you did it.
- Each group briefly presents its results.
