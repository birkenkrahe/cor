** Introduction

As the course "Game Programming with Python" draws to a close, I find
myself reflecting on my journey, much like Meno in Plato's
dialogue. The course focused on creating simple games, following the
first four chapters of *Invent Your Own Computer Games with
Python*. Throughout this reflection, I will explore what I learned, the
challenges I faced, how I recognized my progress, and what areas I
still need to explore further.

** Learning Through the Theme of the Course

The course introduced me to the basics of game programming using
Python, focusing on simple projects like text-based games. I learned
to work with essential programming concepts such as loops,
conditionals, functions, and basic data structures. By building games
like *Guess the Number* and *Hangman*, I gained a practical understanding
of how to apply these concepts in a structured way.

Much like Meno's exploration of virtue, I approached game programming
with curiosity and an open mind. The process of breaking down game
mechanics into smaller coding tasks reminded me of Socratic
questioning—each function or loop was a step toward understanding the
whole game. This methodical approach helped me grasp the importance of
problem-solving and logical thinking in programming.

** Experiencing 'Growing Pains'

One of the most challenging moments in the course was when I attempted
to implement the logic for the *Hangman* game. Managing the game’s
flow—tracking guessed letters, updating the display, and handling
win/loss conditions—proved to be more complex than I anticipated. This
challenge was a significant 'growing pain,' similar to Meno's struggle
when Socrates reveals the gaps in his understanding of virtue.

The frustration I felt when my code didn't work as expected mirrored
Meno’s confusion. However, this struggle also pushed me to learn
more. I had to revisit basic concepts and ask questions, both in class
and online, to overcome these difficulties. This process of grappling
with a problem, failing, and then finding a solution was a crucial
part of my learning experience.

** Recognizing New Learning

I knew I had learned something new when I was able to successfully
code the *Hangman* game and see it run without errors. Watching the game
function as intended—tracking guesses, updating the word display, and
correctly ending the game—was a clear indication that I had
internalized the key concepts. This realization was akin to the moment
in *Meno* when Socrates' questioning leads the slave boy to recognize
his own knowledge of geometry.

Another significant moment of recognition came when I was able to
explain my code to a classmate who was struggling. The ability to
articulate my understanding and help someone else solidified my
confidence in what I had learned.

** Future Learning

While I have gained a solid foundation in game programming, I am aware
that there is much more to learn. The games we created were simple,
and I know that more complex games require a deeper understanding of
topics like object-oriented programming, game loops, and graphics
handling.

I will know I have more to learn when I encounter new programming
challenges that I cannot easily solve or when I struggle to extend the
basic games we built in class into more complex projects. These
moments will signal that it’s time to delve deeper into Python,
explore more advanced concepts, and continue honing my skills.

** Conclusion

In conclusion, the "Game Programming with Python" course has been an
enlightening experience, much like Meno's journey with Socrates. I
have learned valuable programming skills, faced and overcome
challenges, and recognized my own growth. However, I am also aware
that this is just the beginning, and there is much more to explore in
the world of game programming. This course has provided me with the
tools and the mindset to continue learning and improving in the
future.
